<p><strong>Update Nov 2015</strong>:</p>
<p>A shell script or waiting inside your program is maybe a possible solution. But after seeing this <a href=""https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/374"" rel=""noreferrer"">Issue</a> I am looking for a command or feature of docker/docker-compose itself.</p>
<p>They mention a  solution for implementing a health check, which may be the best option. A open tcp connection does not mean your service is ready or may remain ready. In addition to that I need to change my entrypoint in my dockerfile.</p>
<p>So I am hoping for an answer with docker-compose on board commands, which will hopefully the case if they finish this issue.</p>
<p><strong>Update March 2016</strong></p>
<p>There is a <a href=""https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/21142"" rel=""noreferrer"">proposal</a> for providing a built-in way to determine if a container is &quot;alive&quot;. So docker-compose can maybe make use of it in near future.</p>
<p><strong>Update June 2016</strong></p>
<p>It seems that the healthcheck will be <a href=""https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/23218"" rel=""noreferrer"">integrated</a> into docker in Version 1.12.0</p>
