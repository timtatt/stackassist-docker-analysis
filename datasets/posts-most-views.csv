<p>This question is different from ""How to get the IP address of the docker host from inside a docker container"" due to the fact that the IP address of the docker host could be the public IP or the private IP in the network which may or may not be reachable from within the docker container (I mean public IP if hosted at AWS or something). Even if you have the IP address of the docker host it does not mean you can connect to docker host from within the container given that IP address as your Docker network may be overlay, host, bridge, macvlan, none etc which restricts the reachability of that IP address.</p>

<p><strong>Update Nov 2015</strong>:</p>
<p>A shell script or waiting inside your program is maybe a possible solution. But after seeing this <a href=""https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/374"" rel=""noreferrer"">Issue</a> I am looking for a command or feature of docker/docker-compose itself.</p>
<p>They mention a  solution for implementing a health check, which may be the best option. A open tcp connection does not mean your service is ready or may remain ready. In addition to that I need to change my entrypoint in my dockerfile.</p>
<p>So I am hoping for an answer with docker-compose on board commands, which will hopefully the case if they finish this issue.</p>
<p><strong>Update March 2016</strong></p>
<p>There is a <a href=""https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/21142"" rel=""noreferrer"">proposal</a> for providing a built-in way to determine if a container is &quot;alive&quot;. So docker-compose can maybe make use of it in near future.</p>
<p><strong>Update June 2016</strong></p>
<p>It seems that the healthcheck will be <a href=""https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/23218"" rel=""noreferrer"">integrated</a> into docker in Version 1.12.0</p>
<p><strong>Update January 2017</strong></p>

<p>What permissions should I apply to the shared volume on the host?</p>

<p>I can think of two options:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>So far I've given everyone read/write access, so I can write to the folder from the Docker container.</p></li>
<li><p>Map the users from host into the container, so I can assign more granular permissions. Not sure this is possible though and haven't found much about it. So far, all I can do is run the container as some user: <code>docker run -i -t -user=""myuser"" postgres</code>, but this user has a different UID than my host <code>myuser</code>, so permissions do not work. Also, I'm unsure if mapping the users will pose some security risks.</p></li>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The <code>postgres</code> official image from the Docker Registry has a volume configured for containers at <code>/var/lib/postgresql/data</code>.</p>

<p>What's the most succinct command to show the volume at <code>/var/lib/postgresql/data</code> in a <code>postgres</code> container?</p>

<p>This is my first time using dockerfiles, but from what I have read (and taken from working configs) I cannot see why this doesn't work.</p>

<p>My id_rsa is in the same folder as my dockerfile and is a copy of my local key which can clone this repo no problem.</p>

<p>Edit: </p>

<p>In my dockerfile I can add:</p>

<pre><code>RUN cat /root/.ssh/id_rsa
</code></pre>

<p>And it prints out the correct key, so I know its being copied correctly.</p>

<p>I have also tried to do as noah advised and ran:</p>

<pre><code>RUN echo ""Host bitbucket.org\n\tIdentityFile /root/.ssh/id_rsa\n\tStrictHostKeyChecking no"" &gt;&gt; /etc/ssh/ssh_config
</code></pre>

<p>This sadly also doesn't work.</p>

Basically, I'm setting up a web-server and a few daemons inside a Docker container. I do the final parts of this through a bash script called <code>run-all.sh</code> that I run through CMD in my Dockerfile. <code>run-all.sh</code> looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>service supervisor start
service nginx start
</code></pre>

<p>And I start it inside of my Dockerfile as follows:</p>

<pre><code>CMD [""sh"", ""/root/credentialize_and_run.sh""]
</code></pre>

<p>I can see that the services all start up correctly when I run things manually (i.e. getting on to the image with -i -t /bin/bash), and everything looks like it runs correctly when I run the image, but it exits once it finishes starting up my processes. I'd like the processes to run indefinitely, and as far as I understand, the container has to keep running for this to happen. Nevertheless, when I run <code>docker ps -a</code>, I see:</p>

<pre><code>➜  docker_test  docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                            COMMAND                CREATED             STATUS                      PORTS               NAMES

</code></pre>

<p>What gives? Why is it exiting? I know I could just put a while loop at the end of my bash script to keep it up, but what's the right way to keep it from exiting?</p>
